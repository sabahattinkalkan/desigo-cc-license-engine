## Feature Set Selection Logic

- **Compact** is selected only if all requirements are within strict Compact limits
- If any Compact limit is exceeded, the engine automatically switches to **Standard**
- The reason for Compact rejection is always shown explicitly

There is no manual override.

## License Optimization

- The engine always selects the **minimum number of licenses**
- Smaller license blocks are preferred where possible
- Results are deterministic and reproducible
